# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

 Hi, Hello, Welcome to the **Data Warehouse** repository! üèÑüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
 This project shows advanced data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights.

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleaning, standardization and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis in final layer.
3. **Gold Layer**: This layer includes business-ready data modeled with star schema that meets the requirments for reporting and analytics.
